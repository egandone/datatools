1. Build a web-app to encapsulate common data change requests
1. Final deployment/runtime will be PCF
1. Authentication via AD/LDAP (?)
   * Maybe try OAuth - not sure how that works internally
1. Authorization - ?
   * Need to figure out how to use AD/LDAP for login but control access to individual features/functionality via a group or maybe just a static list?
1. Use [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) for server-side page rendering
1. Use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for CSS and JS support
